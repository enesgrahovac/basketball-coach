# Recording Cancellation Fix

## üêõ Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When users cancelled or stopped recording, the video was still being uploaded and analyzed.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Cancellation Tracking**
- Added `wasCancelled` flag to track user intent
- Differentiates between:
  - **Cancel button tap** ‚Üí Sets `wasCancelled = true`
  - **Record button tap to stop** ‚Üí Normal completion
  - **15-second timeout** ‚Üí Normal completion

### 2. **Delegate Method Logic**
```swift
func fileOutput(_ output: AVCaptureFileOutput, didFinishRecordingTo outputFileURL: URL, ...) {
    if wasCancelled {
        // Clean up the recorded file
        try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: outputFileURL)
        return // Don't call onRecordingComplete
    }
    
    // Only call completion handler if not cancelled
    onRecordingComplete?(outputFileURL)
}
```

### 3. **File Cleanup**
- Automatically deletes recorded files when cancelled
- Prevents orphaned temporary files
- Cleans up on both cancellation and recording errors

### 4. **State Management**
- Resets `wasCancelled = false` when starting new recording
- Proper UI state updates
- Clear visual feedback for user actions

## üéØ User Experience

### **Before Fix:**
1. User records video
2. User taps "Cancel" 
3. ‚ùå Video still gets uploaded and analyzed

### **After Fix:**
1. User records video  
2. User taps "Cancel"
3. ‚úÖ Recording is discarded, no upload/analysis
4. User returns to previous screen

### **Normal Completion Still Works:**
1. User records video
2. User taps record button to stop OR 15 seconds elapses
3. ‚úÖ Video gets uploaded and analyzed as expected

## üîß Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `ios/BasketballCoach/Views/CameraRecorder.swift`

**Key Changes:**

**Testing Scenarios:**
1. ‚úÖ Cancel during countdown ‚Üí No recording, no upload
2. ‚úÖ Cancel during recording ‚Üí File deleted, no upload  
3. ‚úÖ Stop recording with button ‚Üí Normal upload/analysis
